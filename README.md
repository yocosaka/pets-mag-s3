## About the Project

This project is based on the lifestyle articles website. 
Instead of the Lifestyle topic, I personalized it having the content of pets.

This web app includes the following features:

- The user logs in to the app, only by typing the username 
- The user is presented with the homepage that includes
  * Featured article with full-width image and title in the first row. This is an article with the biggest number of votes
  * List of all categories in order of priority. Each category is displayed as a square with its name on the top and its most recent article's title at the bottom. The background image is the image of the most recent article in this category
- When the user clicks the category name, they can see all articles in that category
  * Articles are sorted by most recent
  * Each article displays: image, title, truncated text as preview and its author-name
  * Add Star button to vote for article (each user can vote only once)
- Each page uses the same top menu and footer:
  * Top menu includes links to pages that are implemented: Home and Write an article
- When the user opens "Write an article" page:
  * A form with all necessary fields is displayed


Plus, I added some useful features:
- All articles view which is showing all articles
- Create a category form that logged in user can create a new category
- My favorites view that shows all articles that the current user voted
- User's page view that shows all articles that each user posted and in the case of the current user, it shows the account setting buttons including edit and delete user
- Applying Responsive Design for all pages so that users can see this website on mobile and tablet.


I followed the guidelines of ["liFEsTlye."](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version) design, including:

- colors
- typographies: font face, size, and weight
- layout: composition and space between elements

Also, I followed guidelines as below:
- Database schema reflects [the given structure](./docs/ERD__articles.png)
- Validate all user input to make sure that none with bad intentions can destroy the app
- Use Postgres as a database
- MVP of the full product (with the full graphical design but only basic features that can be easily extended in the future)
